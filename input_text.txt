What story do you really want to tell but no one has asked the right question for you to bring it up?
When I was like 6 y/o, my dad taught me how to grab ants with the tip of my fingers in a way that the ant couldn't bite me and I wouldn't hurt it. I'm talking about those big red leaf cutter ants. In my country we call them bachacos.

Now, in my schools playground, there were a lot of these ants. I taught my friends how to grab them with the fingertips technique and we would spend all our recess time playing with ants.

Eventually, as we were evil little curious kids, we found out that if we plucked out their antennas, they wouldn't recognize each other and would fight to death. Knowing this, we would spend our day looking for the best battle ants we could find, to make them kill each other for our entertainment.

It was only matter of time until we began making bets. We also started selling each other the best warriors and more and more kids joined the business. We didn't know that we were doing something wrong, but we kept it a secret from our teachers only because they wouldn't let us play with insects.

The place where we kept our fighters and the bowl we used as our coliseum, received the name of Bachacolandia, which translates to something like Antland.

One day a kid found a really really big ant, and sold it to another kid for like three times the price of a regular ant. When the big moment came, the big ant turned out to be a really bad fighter and got it's head cut off by a normal size ant. The kid said that he got scammed and wanted his money back, so they started fighting. This got our teacher involved, and she was horrified when she found out what we were doing, and that was the end of Bachacolandia.
